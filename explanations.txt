INTRODUCTION
At first, I place several important links for the project and comments.

CHECKING SOLUTIONS FOR PYTHON 2: 
https://github.com/OlgaBelitskaya/resume-builder/blob/master/Udacity_Technical_Interview_Project_Code.ipynb

In the file "solutions.py" there were added the lines to estimate the time of every solution.

SOLUTIONS
The next part is explanations for solutions.

SOLUTION 1.
The solution is based on the clear reasons:

- creating the lists of elements from both strings list() is needed for analysis;
- the use the boolean AND np.logical_and() gives the result "True" if all symbols from the second string are in the first one;
- the list of indices of the first string for elements from the second string is made in the same loop;
- applying functions for the indices [sum(), map(), abs(), .diff()] helps to find exactly anagrams: 
if sorted indices have the absolute values of differences 1 and therefore symbols from the second string 
stand consecutively in the first one then the function returns "True".

Efficiency: 𝒬(n^2⋆m), where n - the length of s and m - the length of t.                                             
Space complexity: 𝒬(N⋆M), where N=len(s), M=len(t). 

SOLUTION 2.
In this case, the solution includes several helper functions. 
It's the most convenient way for me to build every step as a separate function in the logical order. 
For all helper functions, I try to find the easiest and quickest way for every concrete operation.
The final function indicates that the word 'a' consists of one letter and can be considered as a palindrome.

Efficiency: 𝒬(n⋆m⋆p), 
where n - the length of a, m - the length of the list with string parts, p - the length if the palindrome list.
Space complexity: 𝒬(N^2), where N=len(a).

SOLUTION 3.
I have chosen the package Networkx as an optimal decision in this case. It makes my task very simple.
I need only to create a graph, apply the function minimum_spanning_tree, and convert the result 
into the certain format of dictionary.

Efficiency:  𝒬(n⋆m⋆log n), where n - the number of nodes and m - the number of edges.
Space complexity:  𝒬(N⋆M), where N=len(n), M=len(m).

SOLUTION 4.
The graph was created from the matrix so that the root has the index 0 and 
all other nodes have received the numbers in order.
Created graph was tested for the number of edges per node (1 to 3) and whether or not it is a tree.
We know exactly the root index, so we can only use three variables.
Now it is possible to find a path between two given nodes in the specified graph and
determine in this path the node with the minimum index. This will be the required number.

Efficiency:  𝒬(n^2), where n - the number of rows (or columns) in the initial matrix.
Space complexity:  𝒬(N), where N=len(n).

SOLUTION 5.
Here I am a bit remade the condition of the original problem. This wording seems to me to be more precise.
Created class consists of a set of functions that allow to find a specific element from the end of the linked list,
and extract other information about a particular linked list.
In the full version of the project, I did a lot more procedures within a given class. 
They do not need to find a given item, and were built for training.

Efficiency:  𝒬(n), where n - the length of the linked list l.
Space complexity:  𝒬(1).

CONCLUSION
Such problems must be solved continuously for advanced training. During the project, I have created a few extra notebooks 
for exercises and going to collect challenges and references therein.
